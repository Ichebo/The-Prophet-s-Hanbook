# The Prophet's Hanbook

## Partial Paralysis & The Typewriter 
In 1996 I started these records using a borrowed portable typewriter, and partly handwritten in an old outdated diary I got from my Uncle. The typewriter has its own story. At that time I had partial paralysis in my writing arm, that is left arm, due to a freak series of events. Back in August 26, 1996 I had gotten saved. I was inspired to record a diary. And that is how the Daily or 24 Hours Analysis Record System was born. Since then I have time to time recorded mainly messages of the One who inspired me to make the record. That is my heavenly Father. 

This person truly exists. Here in these records I endeavor to share his record to me and others. Some things he instructed me to do. Maybe in this phase I might do better at keep track of his instruction. When the instructions is taken into action. And the events and results of the actions.  

The record has evolved over the years. It starts as simple record of divine communications during prayer and quite time sessions. It has evolved to add the daily analysis record. This record I find to be most difficult to keep. It requires me to self-examine at a daily basis. My Soul finds it difficult to bear it and would time and time again sabotage the whole recording process.

## The Properties Library
As I grew into the work of my Father, I added the work of concepts. This is an attempt to make a collection for the ideas and concepts of the Kingdom. In a way it would a contribution to the public. I found that there a few if not any works that have a collection of concepts of the kingdom. 

Also that part of the work was started was a prayer to understand the systems of the enemy right from the Bible. This was the beginng actually. The work I called the 'Strategies Of The Enemy'. The Father taught me how to develop an interpretation system to do just that. Out of that work, I begun to realise that I had just scratched the surface. 

## Developing The Method Of Dream Interpretation
At that time there  was also the issue of my dreams that were bothering me. After inquiring from the Father, it was cleared that it was something I had to learn to do. That is learn to interpret my dreams and build a system of interpretation from scratch. You can find [the work on dream here](docs/dreams-journal.md).

## Understanding The Wider Applications Of An Interpretation Method
As the Hierarchy And Relationship method became a thing, wider applications and implications begun to show up. At this stage Father directed me to begin the work of building the Prophet's Handbook. I think by then I had grown enough in knowledge and skills for this next stage. 

## Building A Prophet's Toolkit
As a budding Practitioner Prophet, I had noticed that in the Body of Christ in the 90s and early 2000s, and where I am located, there was little or non who were capable of raising and training prophets. And the knowledge of raising a Prophetic Company. And what tools are needed to build such a company. That is how by the help the Father I started developing these tools and methodolgies for restoring the lost art of the Practitioner Prophets and the Company of Prophets. 

## About The Handbook
Currently the Handbook has collection of several journal systems and libraries that make up Keys Libraries and Reference Library. It has a Bible that will be reference system for the key libraries. The methodologies for developing these tools and other tools that will explained in other parts of this work. Welcome to the greater world!!
