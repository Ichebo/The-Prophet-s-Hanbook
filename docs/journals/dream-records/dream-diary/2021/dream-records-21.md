# Prophet Larry' Dream Diary

# Week 4

## 27 Jan. 21: Class Test

I was at Evelyn Hone College. Mrs Lenaud was giving us a test. Other students, I saw Bessie, had decided to cheat on the test. They would go to their room and find answers to the questions from google. I decided to do the same. But each time I went to my room I would be distract by giving attention to Lubhuto. I went to the room about three or four times. Each time to no avail. And I felt unprepared for the test. When I finally decided to go seat and write the test. Immediately I sat down and picked up my paper, Mrs Lenaud came got my paper saying time is up. In my mind I said I didn't mind failing the test as I have done it before. And that I could still try to write the remaining tests on other subjects. It reminded me of the other dreams before I had of not being prepared for the test deciding not to seat for the tests.

# Week 5

## 30 Jan. 21: Gun Shot Pt.

I'm a soldier. This a continuation of dream I had before early January. In that dream we were 3 soldiers. Our ranking soldier, his younger brother and myself.

The younger yielded a machine gun. He fired several shots. His shooting method was flawed. The ranking came and said the bad shooting was as result of not absolving the recoil of each shot as the gun fired. He said the younger brother should have secured the butt of the gun with his shoulder.

### Gun Shot Pt.2

The ranking officer went to distant hill made up with bare grey rock face. I was left behind. I watch them as they got to rock. I had the younger brother's gun. So, I decided to use the technic our ranking soldier advised. I snuggled the butt of the rifle onto the should firmly then I took aim at some area of the rock face. I shot two or three rounds on the rock.

Two or more soldier came to where I was standing. As we were talking about me taking aim where the ranking was. And that I would in trouble with him. A package came from someone who was sent by the ranking soldier. It was a gift he was given from the people he met with at the rock.

Unpacking the gift, it was a used clipper set. It has other accessories with. There were all used. Looked like it had been in used for a long time but also in good condition because it is keep well.

## Monday 1 Feb. 21

I dreamt of my father Mr Mudenda. The symbol is one of the keys in the library. Please make an entry.

## Tuesday 2 Feb. 21: Sansui Speakers

These boys and I were organising an event. _(note: key for a party or a feast is translated plans and their events)_. I observed as the boys put together a stereo. They hook it up to Sansui speakers _(note: I regard Sansui as an inferior brand and sound quality)_. So, at first there was no speakers. So, it came as a relief they found them, and as a surprise they were playing sound really well. The bass was booming great and on point.

Later I with my woman (could be Alison), I saw Michael Nkonde come in for the event. I went up to him to offer him my condolences over the loss of his child. He wanted to avoid the issue. I got a sense that it offended him that I would engage him on that. He responded and quick excused him self and moved on.

### Abri Potgieter is Opts not to Retaliate

It was several of us in a room. There were several white folks reclining on what seems like a bed. Abri Potgieter _(note: my boss at Celtic, was super hectic basically a slave driver. Did want to see us leave on time. Over working us was his way of running things)_ was among them. I behind these folks with a few other black people who seemed to be past employee of Celtic. While I was trying to move, I had to move over Abri's feet so I press on them. He looked over I saw that it was me. He said in other circumstances that would have been a problem.

### The Rooms with the Grimy brown walls

The dream went to another scene. The people I was with felt like the ones I was with at the based of that bed recliner thing by Abri. We passed through what seem like some rooms in my old boarding school. The walls were grimy. They had what looked like brown grime swear on the walls and door frames.

### Chrisbour Drives and Crashes

We (Chrisbour, others and myself) are coming from somewhere (probably the continuation from the other scenes). We arrived at a police facility. Our aim was to pass through and continue on our journey. Two or so police personnel say they will help us get to where we are going. Somehow if we don't get help, we could have landed in trouble with the police. So, they helped us get a military grade vehicle. We continued to our intended destination.

The terrain in this place was alien. It didn't look like any like place here on earth. The ground and the vegetation were strange. So, the colours were also similar to the room but strange not commonly find in nature.

At one point Chris's driving got out control. He got to a place where he was driving in reverse and managed to drive off a short cliff and we fell the base. The police person who vouched to help us lost confidence in Chris driving and started to question our intentions in that area. It is guarded by the police. This question was depicted like a chase. With the police questioning being the chaser and Chris lack response the escapee.

## Thursday 11 February 2021

My Father Mr. Mudenda I was observing him. He was getting ready to go to work. He hid something he didn't want me to take. He wore his pilot's uniform for his flight bag and for out of the house. This time I observed him as I was behind a shrub with a few other people. He walked out of the gate and didn't wait for company transport. I wondered why he did so.

# Week 7

## Saturday 13 February 2021

### Louie Goes Full Goku

I went to this pool club. I found Clive and Louie playing pool of a normal table. They had turned it into makeshift table. I greeted them was happy to see Louie back home. Other guys were waiting for their turn to play. I complained to the two brothers that I seem not to let them play.

After some exchange of words, Louie got furious. Clive tried to cool him down but Louie got violent and tore the place down. He had super human powers and strength. The place was blow like a huge wind and telekinetic power was blowing out of your Louie. I had a narrative Clive was telling me that's how Louie is now. He has these powers and uncontrollable destructive rage when he is offended.

On another occasion this happened on a street where he blew out 2-3 guys for offending him. Other time he was offended by the Celtic people. I knew he was heading there so I hurried there to get the people out of there before he got to the place. They were determined to stay and mount some defence. Phineas was there we spoke as the wind begun to blow. Louie appeared and tore the place up in rage. This time he was flying around and emitting visible energy (green colour).

I escaped from there hoping not to get caught. Louie found me. I pleaded with him not to harm me. That I had children. He asking me in anger where I was and what did I contribute to them leaving the country to settle in America and get prosperous. That when I noticed that the rage came out of that place of pain. And it was being trigger by his interactions and offence he picked up from people.

I told him I was glad when I heard they had left East Africa for the US. That was the contribution I made I told him so. He started to calm. He told me about the powers and about his current woman. Or at least there was a narrative going on.

Then some guys showed up and tick Louie off. He begun flying around and he caused massive destruction. I got away to avoid being harmed.

### At Pamela's house

Another dream scene, this time I went to 115 Omega. I discovered that the place had smaller and poorer. The kids were looking mal-nourished and poorly dressed. In my mind I was like this is the feeling I got that things were not okay. I spoke to her that I wanted the children.

# Week 8

### Pamela Still Telling Lies About Me

I found out that Pamela had been going about maligning my name because of leaving her. She was motivated seeking out everyone she can find who knows me. This way she can continue hating me. I confronted her about and ended up in shouting fight that got physical.

## Friday 19 February 2021

### Director and his video crew

I was helping out this young to organise his project. We were in this place. It was like he lived there and worked there. So, I was organising his leather folder. I had figured out easier and efficient way for filing. I had gone to the back to do sorting of the file. Busied my myself to carry favour. I showed the person but he seemed not interested in my efforts.

Another scene this person was now Admire. One person came to tell him he would be in trouble with his landlord for lack of settling rentals. He shrugged the person off. I continued try to impress upon my efforts but he paid no attention. Another person a woman came to warn of the impending trouble she shrugged off.

He went out. I thought leaving so I went out. I was sort of caught in limbo because I could find my way out. No matter how I tried.

### Admire Back on the Scene with Betty

Admire came back with Betty the Actor lady from Zambia. Made pleasantries. Then she asked me about my grandfather and if I knew him. In what she meant was if I knew my great grandfather. He said that she read about a Venezuelan write who wrote about European man who travel to Africa those parts and left children there. This man was part of an expedition on a French car into Africa. The car was probably a Citroen.

I got so emotional that I didn't know my great grandfather.

## Sunday 21 February 2021

### Alison And The Prophet

There was a prophet that Alison had been going to. I found out that they had sex. Upon confronting she admitted that it happened. In fact she was to meet him again. She said it was not meant to happen the sex, it was a mistake. But she looked like she was under the spell of this man. It seemed like when ever be wanted her she would drop anything and go to him.

The feeling of the dream was that betrayed and funding that out using sheer strength and also sapped the feelings of losing a life to another man.

## Monday 22 February 2021

### Alison and the new house

I bought a house. It costed us R1.04 million. It was in a T shape. The horizontal front block I thought would be converted into lounge and that stuff. While the vertical block would become bedrooms and such stuff.

I went to tell Alison about the house. She didn't seem interested. I was following her about trying to get her attention. She was either in the phone or busying her self. I wondered why because we had planned to get a house. Was it because I had settled for this one.

## Tuesday 23 February 2021

### Pamela Mocking

I was in this place (new never been here before). It felt like I was confined to this place. There was an emphasis on the detail of the place.

Walking I saw Pamela talking to Anita and others. She was mocking me. She hasn't seen that me behind her. When she did she showed not regret. Rather she begins to antagonize me further. I got angry and fought her. Getting physical I told myself I'm losing it. This fighting thing I shouldn't do it.

So I left went back to where I was. Nkhalo was there too in this place. Got into the building found one of the dark kiddies who were Nkhalo's by the flat. He had some health issues. He is paralysed, dumb and mute. I'm concerned that he is not receiving enough attention. I feel obligated to help him. I felt guilty I think.

So Nkhalo and me want to Kindle the lost love. So when sleeping we share a bed. Then we kiss.

Scene change. In the same room again with Nkhalo but this time we have Stanley and other guy from Avondale come and seat in a circle in the room. That dumb boy has been sleeping for more that 15-20 hours. I'm asking others whether he woke or are. I'm thinking be met starve to death like this. I feel I must check on him.

The School Riot and Escape

## Wednesday 3 February 2021

### DREAMS

#### Traffic Cop

Alison, a child, and myself are going to some place. We get in a taxi (mini bus). Driving the bus is pulled over by a traffic Cop. We all have to get out.

This police man is seated in a bush on a small stool of sorts. Writing out something to do with a charge. He charge that the taxi would be impounded. The passengers were not happy and complained. However none dared to question the validity of this charge.

I stepped up to question the cop to give me the premise of his charge. What law he had applied that the taxi broke. He wasn't responding. But looked his composure was rattled.

The people are saying yes someone ought to talk. And in my mind I'm like yes me I talk. You need to sound like you know the law. Then you will see this people quake.

This dream is in the day time.

#### Alison going to feed her beast

Alison says she needs to use the toilet that's in her way to feed the animal. The animal is some sort of large dog like beast in the sense that it kept like you would a pet dog. She wants me to come with her and help out.

This dream is at night.

She reminds me again. Must be second it third time not entirely certain. I go with her though didn't want. We stop by the toilet. She is becomes weak and falls to the floor. She has a temperature. I'm telling her you haven't been honest. You are bidding that you are not well.

At that time someone is there too showing concern and trying to help.

#### 31 Ngwerere Packing

There is packing going on. I have a boy with me in the kitchen. On the curtain rail that is on the window by the door leading to kitchen verandah, they are some containers that belonged to my mother. I'm thinking I will take them.

Lulu and Rachel are there. So I take some carved ornaments from the living room. As I pick one there seem to transform into some favorable designs. I pick one then I found another. Now I not cannot really limit my choice but I'm getting them. I have three. In my mind I'm telling these and trying to avoid my sisters confronting me. So I settle of sort conceal them as pass Rachel in the corridor as I head to my former bedroom. I need to find my bag and place the ornaments in it. There is issues finding it. Eventual found.

I go to the kitchen find the boy. We share some information how this was were I lived. Then I notice the containers in top of the curtain never been washed. And have turned out to be ornamental tea or sugar cannisters. One of them had got this blue green colour. I remember it shape like something. I get them as well. Saying they used to be my mother's. I will keep them. As I pass Lulu.

# WEEK 10

## Saturday 6 March 2021

### DREAMS

I was complaining that the work load is too much to someone (dream kind of fuzzy now). Yaliwe was talking about are task on one of her businesses. I was like yes will to do it. Then about three times I told that her Celo money her come through. Each time she goes to check there a Chameleon visible only, the coiled tail. Emphasized by spot light. The coiled tailed main colour red. This tail would nudge something on the electronics. When she checks she would find no money has been transferred.

The last time she came back she said her brother. She called him the boss wanted to see me. So when I asked where he was she said upstairs. But for some reason he was hard to located.

## Sunday 7 March 2021

This dream is hard to remember:

3 times I went to this place it had to do with CorelDRAW or business. Lulu and seems like children were would come there on those three occasions. They didn't take seriously what that place was about.

### Babongile Scene

After that I saw that Babongile was there. She was working on a side project for the church she attends. I wonder speaking to myself, I didn't know she devoted to Christian work.

### John Wants to start a Newspaper

So John meets me on my way to business, stops me and asks, "how much is a newspaper design on CorelDRAW?" I was thinking this guy is absurd. He does even look a person who can run a paper. He asked me for the something else he wants to do. Must have been radio media.

### Lost

I'm in this place. Have to leave where I was with my relative cause there was some kind of upheaval. So, I find my way to this place. I need to a safe place to hide to avert capture. I find this place where this is woman. The place is high on some poles. She accepts to shelter me. I wander about having this feeling of being lost. Then find my way back. We make with this woman. As we make out I'm thinking this is not as good or something like that. I'm thinking that I can stop now and do it again later.
