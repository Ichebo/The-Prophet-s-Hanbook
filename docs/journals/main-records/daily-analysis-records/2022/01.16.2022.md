**Concerning Pamela.** I'll breakdown because of you. I'll teach her a lession because of you.

**Don't Look To What has fallen out.** Look to what you got in your hand not what has fallen. This is a lesson about understanding that your grasp will retain something. Picture you taking a pinch of salt of grains of sand. There will be some that is left in your grasp and some that will fall out.
